Project Title

What drives the recent surge in inflation? The historical decomposition roller coaster

Overview

Replication of estimation codes for the paper using MATLAB 2022b.

Codes run about 2 hours on a powerful laptop (48 hours on a mid-range laptop).

All data is stored in .xlsx files in the Data/ folder.

Output figures are saved in Figures/.

Scripts are in the main folder; helper functions are in Functions/.

Software Requirements

MATLAB R2022b must be installed.

Random seed fixed at start of each script for reproducibility.

Data

Data files (.xlsx) in Data/ folder:

US bivariate.xlsx

US large.xlsx

EuroArea FRED.xlsx

IMF data different countries.xlsx

Computational Requirements

Minimum 2.5 GB free disk space.

Recommended specs: 16GB RAM, quad-core processor.

Key Scripts to Run (Order recommended)

macro VAR diffuse.m — main bivariate VAR estimation and figures.

macro VAR diffuse 83 19.m — sample to 2019.

Other macro VAR *.m scripts (various estimations with different priors, countries).

simulation VAR*.m scripts — simulate artificial data and evaluate models.

Folder Structure
/Data          # All input .xlsx files  
/Functions     # Supporting functions called by scripts  
/Figures       # Output figures generated by scripts  

Execution Instructions

Run MATLAB scripts in the order provided to replicate results.

Each script loads necessary data, estimates models, and saves figures automatically.

No manual interaction expected once started.

Dockerfile Notes for Automation

Use MATLAB Runtime (if available) or full MATLAB install.

Copy /Data, /Functions, and main scripts into container.

Set MATLAB version to R2022b.

Allocate minimum 2.5GB disk space and adequate RAM.

Execute scripts sequentially with matlab -batch "scriptname" commands.

Capture outputs in /Figures mounted or copied out of container.
